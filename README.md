# Timed-Highlights ðŸ“… ðŸ“Œ
This is a moderation tool for creating timed-highlight posts in your community. The tool adds a menu option for moderators to create timed highlight/sticky posts in the community. Once the given number of days are elapsed, the post will be automatically unstickied/removed from highlights ( so moderators need not remember to unsticky/remove from highlights later).
